# Sidu
Sidu is an Education Management Application that helps students to identify suitable courses & career paths that match their interests &
strengths. Using Machine Learning algorithms, SIDU learns & draws patterns from the scores of students(class scores, examination scores) in order to predict suitable courses and possible career paths for students at the Basic Level & the Senior High School Level.

In most countries in Africa such as Ghana, students often struggle in choosing the right courses after completing Basic School or 
Senior High School. This is mainly due to various reasons; particularly due to the lack of data that can be studied to identify the strengths, interests
& weaknesses of students. Most schools in Ghana lack a proper record system. One that includes the long term performance of students that can
be assessed to identify patterns in the data that can be useful to the student in deciding what course to choose after school or what career 
paths to pursue.
